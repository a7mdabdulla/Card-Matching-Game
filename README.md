## Game's Name: Cards Matching Game ##

### Description: 
The Card Matching Game is a memory challenge to test your focus and your ability to memorize. The objective is to find and match pairs of cards by flipping two cards each time. If the two cards have identical images, they remain visible; otherwise, they flip back. You can make up to 5 mistakes (strikes). If you match all the cards before reaching 5 strikes, you win! If you reach 5 strikes before matching all cards, you lose.
